# Django Web App Demo
### A demo website written in Python's Django framework

This project is based on the essentials learned from the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) tutorials which can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).
I have expanded upon the basic tutorial by including the most recent packages as of October 2018 and revised sections, including units tests, to reflect Dango 2.1 changes. I have designed the front-end by using examples from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/).

Added basic text search that uses Django's built in functions for PostgreSQL, based on this [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/postgres/search/).

Added a lightweight API for data extraction and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for data visualization.
