# django_web_app_demo
### A demo website written in Python's Django framework

This project is based on the essentials learned from the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) tutorials which can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).
I have expanded upon the basic tutorial by including the most recent packages as of October 2018 and revised sections, including units tests, to reflect Dango 2.1 changes. I have also designed the front-end myself by using examples directly from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/).
